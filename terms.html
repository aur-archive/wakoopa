<h3>In super-duper lawyer talk (the full story)</h3>
<p>

Wakoopa provides its service to you subject to the following Terms of Use ("Terms"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. By visiting our website or using our service you automatically agree to be bound by the Terms as set out below, even if you have not explicitly consented to this by clicking on “I agree” or a similar online consent mechanism.
<br /><br />
